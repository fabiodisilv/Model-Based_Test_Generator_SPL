Developing a SPL-based solution for testing, even though it has a significant cost in the early stages, will change the way test scripts are developed from a ""coding"" perspective to a configuration management perspective. Writing a test case will consist in the selection of a set of features instead of the current coding approach, this will increase test case quality (more people using and improving the same features) and also reduce the resources used to develop new test cases (re-use the same features, instead of rewriting them over and over for different test cases). Maintenance of existing scripts will also benefit from this approach (reusable feature maintenance vs. individual test case maintenance).","5","2","Initial cost will be significant since it will require an extensive domain analysis that covers all possible use cases (or at least that aims to do so). However, since this will  greatly reduce the overhead in the development and maintenance of each test case, over time the ROI shall be positive, improving over time and eventually reaching a point where the resources used to develop/maintain test cases tend to 0. ","Feature modelling is crucial for the usage os SPLs. Thus, feature oriented domain analysis and implementation are skills that must be developed in order to achieve this goal.","SPL development is compatible with Agile working methods. Using this approach may require some adaptation in the current methods and processes but, if that's the case, I don't think that meaningful changes are needed.","Understanding the software requirements I am testing.

Moreover, the automatic generation completely reduces the possibility of manual errors.","3","1","Even though the initial modelling phase is moderately heavy for large SPLs, on the middle-long term the approach is going to drastically decrease the costs associated to maintenance and manual errors of traditional approaches.","For the end user a low skill level is required to create models and write test cases with the DSL. It's actually required to have less skills compared to a test engineer with a computer science background since the tools offer an intuitive GUI to build the models and the DSL is close to natural language. If the enabling artefacts (metamodels, DSL, model to text transformation) have to be developed, a good knowledge of MDE concepts is required.","May be required to create a temporary team in charge of executing the set-up phase.","With the current approach is difficult to keep track of the different project variances due to a lack of formalism to represent them. Due to this difficulty, it's sometimes hard to retrieve project specific details, especially at low level (signal) to adapt the test scripts. Replicated test scripts fails sometimes due to incorrect project specific signals specification leading to software deliverables delays. ","5"
